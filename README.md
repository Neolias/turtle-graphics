# Turtle Graphics

The Turtle Graphics application was developed by a team of students during the *Object-Oriented Programming with C++* course organized by Aalto University in the fall of 2024. The team was supervised by specialists from Qt Group Plc. The resulting application received high praise from the supervisors, and all team members received excellent grades for the course.

The application was developed using the Qt Creator and Qt Quick libraries. It represents a tool used for visualizing vector graphics patterns by manipulating a turtle cursor. The application is capable of reading scripts loaded from files or short user inputs directly from the nested command line interface (CLI). Patterns are then drawn on a canvas by executing commands in a sequence.

It is possible to save and load turtle states from files, allowing for version control. Additionally, GUI snapshots can be saved in the PNG format if needed.

Lastly, a gamification touch is added to the application by implementing obstacles diversifying the user experience. Thus, if the turtle cursor hits obstacles, the collision event is processed, possibly leading to unique results.
